# Pathfinding algorithm visualiation project
This is a project to visualize different pathfinding algorithms. It is written in Javascript and react. The project is still in development and more algorithms will be added in the future.

## How to run
To run the project, you need to have node.js installed. Then run the following commands in the project directory:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then open the project in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

## How to use
The project is very simple to use. You can click start node, end node and build walls as obstacles for the algorithm. Then choose algorithm and press Search. You can also change the speed of the visualization.

## Algorithms
The project currently supports the following algorithms:
* Dijkstra
* A*

Maze is generated using Prism's algorithm.

## TODO
* Add more algorithms
* Add more features
* Add more documentation
* Host project online for easier access
